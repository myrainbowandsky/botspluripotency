The code has been tested on Python3.10

The X dataset is in X_data, but can also be available on Dryad (https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.1ns1rn91w).

The majority of figures are derived from intermediate data, which is, in principle, generated from raw data. However, the processing functions for generating this intermediate data are not provided. This omission is due to the fact that additional tweet information may violate X Policies. We may provide additional information upon request.
